## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- npm or yarn


### Application Setup
Open the `backend` folder as the project root, then install and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

On first setup, `npm install` and `npm run dev` automatically create `.env` and `frontend/.env` from their `.env.example` files if they do not already exist. Existing `.env` files are never overwritten.

This starts the **backend API** and **frontend dev server** at the same time.

### For Frontend Developers
Even if you are working on frontend tasks only, run the backend together with the frontend using `npm run dev` from the `backend/` folder.

The UI depends on the API for login, data loading, form submission, and error handling. Running the frontend alone will only show the login screen and most features will not work. Running both services lets you verify the full frontend behavior and its communication with the backend.


### Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5007
- **Demo Credentials**:
  - Username: `admin@school-admin.com`
  - Password: `3OU4zn3q6Zh9`


### Database Setup
Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
# Create PostgreSQL database
createdb school_mgmt

# Run database migrations
psql -d school_mgmt -f seed_db/tables.sql
psql -d school_mgmt -f seed_db/seed-db.sql
```

## 🎯 Skill Test Problems

All paths below are relative to the repository root unless noted otherwise.

### **Problem 1: Frontend Developer Challenge**
**Fix "Add New Notice" Page**
- **Route**: `/app/notices/add`
- **Primary files**:
  - `backend/frontend/src/domains/notice/pages/add-notice-page.tsx`
  - `backend/frontend/src/domains/notice/components/notice-form.tsx`
  - `backend/frontend/src/domains/notice/api/notice-api.ts`
- **Issue**: When clicking the **Save** button, the `description` field doesn't get saved
- **Skills Tested**: React, Form handling, State management, API integration
- **Expected Fix**: Ensure the description field is properly bound and submitted to the API
- **How to test**: Run `npm run dev` from `backend/`, log in, open **Notices → Add New Notice**, save, and confirm the description persists

### **Problem 2: Backend Developer Challenge**
**Complete CRUD Operations in Student Management**
- **Primary files**:
  - `backend/src/modules/students/students-controller.js`
  - `backend/src/modules/students/students-service.js`
  - `backend/src/modules/students/students-repository.js`
  - `backend/src/modules/students/sudents-router.js`
- **Issue**: Implement missing CRUD operations for student management
- **Skills Tested**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, API design, Error handling
- **Expected Implementation**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- **How to test**: With the API running from `backend/`, test `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/students` using Postman or curl

### **Problem 3: Blockchain Developer Challenge**
**Implement Certificate Verification System**
- **Objective**: Add blockchain-based certificate verification for student achievements
- **Suggested locations**:
  - Smart contracts: new `contracts/` directory at repository root or inside `backend/`
  - Frontend integration: `backend/frontend/src/domains/`
  - Admin UI: extend student-related pages under `backend/frontend/src/domains/student/`
- **Skills Tested**: Smart contracts, Web3 integration, Ethereum/Polygon
- **Requirements**:
  - Create smart contract for certificate issuance and verification
  - Integrate Web3 wallet connection in the frontend
  - Add certificate management in the admin panel
  - Implement IPFS for certificate metadata storage
- **How to test**: Run the app from `backend/` with `npm run dev`, connect a wallet, issue a certificate, and verify it on-chain

### **Problem 4: Golang Developer Challenge**
**Build PDF Report Generation Microservice via API Integration**
- **Objective**: Create a standalone microservice in Go to generate PDF reports for students by consuming the existing Node.js backend API
- **Location**: new `go-service/` directory at the repository root
- **Backend dependency**: Node.js API in `backend/` must be running on `http://localhost:5007`
- **Description**: Connect to `GET /api/v1/students/:id`, use the returned JSON to generate a downloadable PDF report
- **Skills Tested**: Golang, REST API consumption, JSON parsing, file generation, microservice integration
- **Requirements**:
  - Create endpoint `GET /api/v1/students/:id/report` in the Go service
  - The Go service must not connect directly to the database; it must fetch data from the Node.js API
  - PostgreSQL and the Node.js backend must be running to complete this task
- **How to test**:
  1. Seed the database from `seed_db/`
  2. Start the API from `backend/` with `npm run dev:server`
  3. Start the Go service
  4. Request `GET /api/v1/students/:id/report` and verify the PDF output

### **Problem 5: DevOps Engineer Challenge**
**Containerize the Full Application Stack**
- **Objective**: Create a multi-container setup to run the entire application stack (Frontend, Backend, Database) using Docker and Docker Compose
- **Location**:
  - `backend/frontend/Dockerfile`
  - `backend/Dockerfile`
  - `docker-compose.yml` at the repository root
- **Description**: Make the development environment reproducible and launchable with a single command
- **Skills Tested**: Docker, Docker Compose, container networking, database seeding in a container, environment variable management
- **Requirements**:
  - Write a `Dockerfile` for the frontend service in `backend/frontend/`
  - Write a `Dockerfile` for the backend service in `backend/`
  - Create a `docker-compose.yml` at the repository root linking frontend, backend, and postgres services
  - Automatically seed postgres from `seed_db/` on first run
  - Launch the full stack with `docker-compose up`
- **How to test**: Run `docker-compose up --build` from the repository root and log in at `http://localhost:5173`

## ✅ Submission Notes — Problem 2: Backend Developer Challenge

This submission addresses **Problem 2 only** (Backend Developer Challenge — Student Management CRUD), as described in the Skill Test Problems section above. Problems 1 (Frontend), 3 (Blockchain), 4 (Golang), and 5 (DevOps) are out of scope for this submission.

### Files changed
- `backend/src/modules/students/students-controller.js` — request handlers for all six endpoints
- `backend/src/modules/students/students-service.js` — business logic: existence checks, status/CRUD orchestration, verification email dispatch
- `backend/src/modules/students/students-repository.js` — SQL/data-access layer, including a new `deleteStudent` query
- `backend/src/modules/students/sudents-router.js` — added the `DELETE /:id` route

No changes were made to the database schema (`seed_db/tables.sql`) — the existing `student_add_update` stored procedure and `users`/`user_profiles` tables were used as-is.

### What was implemented

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth required |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/students` | List students. Accepts optional query params `name`, `className`, `section`, `roll` to filter results | Yes |
| GET | `/api/v1/students/:id` | Full profile detail for one student (contact info, class/section, parent/guardian info, admission date, reporting teacher) | Yes |
| POST | `/api/v1/students` | Create a new student. Triggers an account-verification email on success | Yes |
| PUT | `/api/v1/students/:id` | Update an existing student's full profile | Yes |
| POST | `/api/v1/students/:id/status` | Enable/disable a student's system access (`{ "status": true \| false }`) | Yes |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/students/:id` | Delete a student (removes both `user_profiles` and `users` rows) | Yes |

All routes sit behind the existing `authenticateToken` and `csrfProtection` middleware already wired up in `backend/src/routes/v1.js` — no changes were needed there.

**Example create/update payload** (matches the fields consumed by the `student_add_update` stored procedure):
```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "gender": "female",
  "dob": "2011-03-14",
  "phone": "9998887777",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "class": "5",
  "section": "A",
  "roll": "21",
  "admissionDate": "2021-06-01",
  "currentAddress": "12 Elm Street",
  "permanentAddress": "12 Elm Street",
  "fatherName": "John Doe",
  "fatherPhone": "9991112222",
  "motherName": "Mary Doe",
  "motherPhone": "9993334444",
  "guardianName": "John Doe",
  "guardianPhone": "9991112222",
  "relationOfGuardian": "Father",
  "systemAccess": true
}
```

Note: `class` and `section` must reference existing rows in the `classes` and `sections` tables (enforced by a foreign key on `user_profiles`) — create the relevant class/section first via the Classes module if the seed data doesn't already include one.

### Bug fix: error messages on failed create

`addNewStudent` previously wrapped the create step in a try/catch that discarded the actual failure reason and always threw a generic `500 "Unable to add student"` — even for a client-correctable error like a duplicate email. This has been fixed so the real reason now propagates with an appropriate status code:

- Before: `POST /students` with a duplicate email → `500 { "error": "Unable to add student" }`
- After: `POST /students` with a duplicate email → `400 { "error": "Email already exists" }`

### Testing

All six endpoints were exercised manually in **Postman** against a locally running instance (`npm run dev:server` from `backend/`, PostgreSQL seeded from `seed_db/tables.sql` + `seed_db/seed-db.sql`). Test flow:

1. **Auth setup** — `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with the demo admin credentials to obtain the `accessToken`/`refreshToken` cookies and the `csrfToken` cookie; the CSRF token value is then sent as the `x-csrf-token` header on every subsequent request (required by the `csrfProtection` middleware already in place for the `/students` route group).
2. **Happy path** — created a student (`POST`), confirmed it appeared in the list (`GET /students`) and in detail view (`GET /students/:id`), updated its profile (`PUT /students/:id`) and re-fetched to confirm the change persisted, toggled its `systemAccess` status (`POST /students/:id/status`), deleted it (`DELETE /students/:id`), then confirmed a follow-up `GET /students/:id` correctly returned `404 { "error": "Student not found" }`.
3. **Filtering** — verified `GET /students?name=...`, `?className=...`, `?section=...`, and `?roll=...` each narrow the result set correctly.
4. **Error paths**:
   - No auth cookies → `401 Unauthorized`
   - Missing/invalid `x-csrf-token` header → `400/403`
   - `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` on a non-existent student ID → `404 { "error": "Student not found" }`
   - `POST /students` with an email that already exists → `400 { "error": "Email already exists" }` (see bug fix above)
   - `POST /students` with a `class`/`section` combination not present in the `classes`/`sections` tables → surfaced as a failed create rather than a silent success, due to the underlying foreign key constraint

Postman was used for the request-by-request verification described above.
